# Process Databases Cleanup Summary

## Removed Unused Code

With Spotify verification moved to `spotify-verify.js`, we cleaned up several unused functions and simplified the logic in `process-databases.js`:

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Functions:

- `generateSearchUrl()` - was never called, fallback search URL generation
- `findSimilarEntry()` - was never called, simple exact matching helper
- `findCanonicalArtist()` - was never called, complex spelling correction logic
- `findCanonicalVenue()` - was never called, complex spelling correction logic

### üßπ Simplified Code:

- Removed verbose variable names (`finalArtistName` ‚Üí just use `band.text`)
- Simplified `findFuzzyMatch()` function signature (removed unused threshold parameter)
- Cleaned up comments to reflect current behavior
- Removed redundant comments about Spotify integration

### ‚úÖ Kept Essential Functions:

- `normalizeText()` and `normalizeForMatching()` - core duplicate detection
- `findFuzzyMatch()` - now simpler, handles both artist (exact) and venue (fuzzy) matching
- `mergeArtistData()` and `mergeVenueData()` - essential for combining duplicates
- `getPreferredArtistName()` - ensures scraped names are preserved
- `applySpellingCorrection()` - conservative spelling fixes
- All non-artist filtering and venue parsing logic

## Result

The script is now **~50 lines shorter** and **much cleaner**:

- No unused code cluttering the file
- Clearer function signatures
- More focused on its core responsibility: processing scraped data into clean databases
- Still preserves all conservative name handling and duplicate detection

## Performance

- Fewer function definitions means slightly faster startup
- Simpler call stack for duplicate detection
- No change to core functionality or behavior

The cleaned up script maintains all the conservative name preservation behavior while being much easier to read and maintain.
