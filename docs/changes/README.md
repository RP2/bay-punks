- 🛠️ **Technical debt cleanup** - Code improvements and refactoring

## Difference from Main Docs

- **Main docs** (`/docs/*.md`) - User-facing documentation, API references, guides
- **Changes docs** (`/docs/changes/`) - Implementation logs, change records, maintenance notes

This separation keeps the main documentation clean and focused while preserving detailed change history for future reference and debugging.
