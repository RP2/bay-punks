# Bay Area Punk Shows

A simple & accessible list of upcoming music shows in the Bay Area inspired by the classic FooPee punk list (currently a work in progress).

## Overview

This project aims to create an easy-to-navigate and search website of upcoming punk rock and alternative music shows throughout the Bay Area. It serves as a community-driven platform for fans to discover new bands, venues, and events that celebrate punk culture.

## Features

- **Upcoming Shows**: Easily find upcoming punk shows in your area with detailed show information.
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Browse shows by date, or explore dedicated artist and venue directories.
- **Artist Profiles**: Comprehensive artist database with verified Spotify links when available, fallback to search.
- **Venue Directory**: Complete venue listings with location details and show history.
- **Spotify Integration**: Automated artist verification against Spotify's database for direct profile links.
- **Smart Search Fallbacks**: Artists not verified on Spotify automatically get search links.
- **Show Statistics**: Track artist show counts, venue usage, and date ranges for comprehensive insights.

## How to Use

1. Visit the list at [shows.wtf](https://shows.wtf) to browse the current list.
2. Use the **Shows** tab to view upcoming concerts by date.
3. Explore the **Artists** tab to discover bands with direct Spotify links when available.
4. Check the **Venues** tab to find show locations and their event history.
5. Contribute by suggesting new shows, venues, or artist information right here on GitHub.

## Spotify Integration

The site features intelligent Spotify integration that:

- **Automatically verifies** artists against Spotify's database
- **Provides direct links** to verified artist profiles
- **Falls back to search** for artists not found on Spotify
- **Minimizes API calls** through smart caching and duplicate detection
- **Tracks verification status** to avoid unnecessary re-processing

Run `npm run verify-spotify` to update artist Spotify links. The system is optimized to make minimal API calls by skipping already verified artists and detecting duplicates.

## Automated Maintenance

The project features a comprehensive automated maintenance system via GitHub Actions:

### ü§ñ **Weekly Maintenance Workflow**

Runs every Monday at 12AM Pacific Time:

1. **Scrapes** new concert data from sources
2. **Processes** databases with duplicate detection and merging
3. **Preserves** Spotify verification data during processing
4. **Verifies** only new artists against Spotify (saves API calls)
5. **Commits** and pushes changes to trigger deployment

### üîÑ **Monthly Recheck Workflow**

Runs on the 1st of each month at 2AM Pacific Time:

1. **Identifies** previously unverified artists
2. **Rechecks** them against Spotify API
3. **Updates** verification status and stats
4. **Commits** any newly verified artists

### üéõÔ∏è **Manual Controls**

- **Weekly workflow options**:

  - `force_spotify: true`: Force revalidation of all artists
  - `max_artists`: Limit validation to a specific number

- **Monthly recheck options**:

  - `limit`: Set maximum artists to recheck (default: 100)
  - `dry_run`: Preview without making changes

- **Run locally**: `npm run maintenance` or `npm run verify-spotify-recheck-artists`

### üìä **Smart Optimizations**

- **In-memory verification**: Prevents file corruption during processing
- **Focused verification**: Only processes truly new artists
- **Conservative rate limiting**: Prevents API throttling in CI environment
- **Smart persistence**: Preserves existing Spotify data during database rebuilding
- **Two-tier approach**: New artist verification + monthly rechecking
